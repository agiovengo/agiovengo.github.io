Hello! My name is Andy! I need to put more information in this category so it looks nicer!

## Early Life

I have been interested in Science ever since I can remember. I recall as a child getting Science magazines via snail mail and searching through them for the "Fun Facts" sections. I would run up to my mom and recite things such as "Did you know that a *flea* can jump over *80 times* its height!?" She would try to entertain my curiosity as much as she could.


## Growing Up

In high school, when I discovered what Physics was, I felt like my life finally had purpose. 
I was faced with this broad and Mathematically intimidating field in front on me, but I was ready to face it. 
For Christmas my senior year of high school, my father bought me a college-level introduction to Physics workbook. 
In four months, I had independently gone through the entire book and worked out every single problem. 
It was almost unhealthy.

Before this time, the field of Mathematics had always held a sour taste in my mouth, but soon enough I found myself seeking wisdom from my highschool's math teachers for assistance.
I recall even approaching teachers that I had never met before to pick their brains about mathematical concepts that I had never had the opportunity to learn.
I needed to know more, so I could learn more, so I could know more to learn more. 
Little did I know that I was stepping  down a path to pursue this endless "`for` loop" for the rest of my life.

I wasn’t exactly sure what I wanted to study In Physics, but I knew that I needed to learn more.
My starting goal when I went to college was to get a PhD in Physics. 
I never changed Physics as my major in my undergraduate work. 
As I powered my way through my sophomore year, I was awarded the University of Southern Mississippi’s “Outstanding Sophomore Award” for the College of Science and Technology. 
This was an incredible honor and pushed me even further. 
I finished my Bachelor of Science in three years and my Master of Science in one year. 
I was trying to learn as much as I could, and the timeframe came easily. 
Starting my junior year, I began attenting my university's graduate courses in Physics.
This was the best way to keep me on track of my goals.
Even my dedicated work was Physics related.
I became a tutor for the university and continued this job from my softmore year until I finished my undergraduate degree.
Then I was able to teach Physics labs at my university, which allowed me to share pieces of my love and directly measure how well I conveyed knowledge.

Remember how I said in highschool my obsession was "*almost unhealthy*?"
Going through college I might have tipped the scales of "unhealthy."
I would easily and unknowingly skip two meals without leaving a book.
I would dream about Physics.
I would re-derive equations in my head as I walked to class.
I would go on hour long bike rides while listening to extra lectures on my phone.
I would even imagine vectors on anything that moved, such as raquetballs and chairs.
By the end of my college experience, I had branded myself with eight tattoos of various Physical and Mathematical laws.
Each one could represent a stepping stone that I had overcome, a permanent reminder of my progression through the rabbit hole.

## NOT YET EDITED: 

Although I graduated quickly, that is not to say that I was not involved. I balanced
academics, research, and Physics outreach through our Society of Physics Students chapter.

The university that I attended had a tiny Physics program. 
I graduated with only two other Physics majors for my undergraduate degree and one for my graduate degree. 
This limited my options for research through both of my degrees. 
The main research that I worked on through college involved Cavity Ringdown Spectroscopy.
Specifically, I characterized the formation of O3 in a radiation-induced atmosphere. 
This was performed by placing an alpha source inside of a vacuum chamber and measuring the ringdown times as a function of time. 
The biggest issue was that our chamber was metal and was stealing free electrons from the reactions taking place inside. 
To combat this, I constructed a new chamber entirely made of Teflon. 
Teflon is fairly inert and does not react much with NO2 or Ozone. 
In the upcoming weeks, I will be running tests on this new chamber and comparing them to both data taken in our metal chamber and data that was computationally generated based on information that I extracted from NIST’s database. 
I will present on this during the semester for my master’s defense and have worked on this project since the end of my Junior year as an undergrad. 
Through this project, I have dealt with a lot of laser repair, spectroscopy software, Labview, Python, and Optics in general.
My Sophomore and Junior year of college, I researched though the Department of Mathematics.
I used Maple to find different geometries for a black hole besides a sphere. 
Through this project, I started with Einstein’s Field Equation and generated Christoffel symbols based on the metric tensor of my spaces. 
After using Maple, I hand checked each of the solutions. 
Although I obtained trivial results for all the attempted cases, I gained computational skills as well as heightened my ability to solve ODEs.
My main desire is to further my knowledge in Optics. 
I would be entirely satisfied if this was done either through an experimental or a computational route. 
I would enjoy either working in an industrial setting or in an academic setting. 
My experience as both a tutor and teaching labs have made me favor academia, but I have never worked in an industrial setting, and have not ruled it out. 
If accepted to OSU, I would like to continue to study Optics, although I would be also willing to study under nearly any branch of Physics.
